## Installing Cypress

1. Install Cypress from npm `npm install --save-dev cypress`
  * More information on [Cypress Installation Docs](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress)

## Configuring Cypress
We will keep the default configuration. However to ease the process of starting and running cypress tests, we will add some additional scripts to the `package.json` file.
2. Add the following scripts to the `package.json`.

```json title="package.json"
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "cy:open": "cypress open",
    "cy:run": "cypress run"
    ...
  }
  ...
}
```

## Starting Cypress
to start cypress tests, run one of the following command in the terminal:
- `npx cypress open`
- `./node_modules/.bin/cypress open`
- `npm run cy:open` (recommended)

More information can be found in the [opening the app docs on cypress.io](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/opening-the-app)

### Write New Tests
Follow the instructions to create your first test: [Writing your first test](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/end-to-end-testing/writing-your-first-end-to-end-test)

Following these instructions will create the `cypress` folder with the following subdirectories:
- `cypress.json`` - all Cypress settings
- **`cypress/e2e`` - test files (specs)**
- `cypress/fixtures`` - mock data
- `cypress/support`` - shared commands, utilities

We're only really interested in the `cypress/e2e` folder; that's where all tests would be. Let's create a new test file in that folder.
:::note
There should already be some sample test files in the folder, you may opt to leave those in as a reference.
:::

> Make sure you're running the application through some server.

* build a test that types your name, selects a choice from the dropdown and then confirms that the history log generated contains the right number of tries and contains the right name.
