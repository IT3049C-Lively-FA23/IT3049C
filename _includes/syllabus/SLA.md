## Service Level Agreement

### Communication policies
* I will acknowledge/respond to all emails within 48 hours
* I will do office hours on an as-needed, appointment-based system. Use the link on the top to schedule a meeting with me or the TA.

### Feedback
* Assignments will be graded and returned within 10 days of the due date.
  * except for the first few weeks until a TA is assigned.
* Most of the assignments will be accompanyed by a suite of automatic tests that can give you an early feedback on your work. For the most part, passing tests means full grade, unless indicated otherwise.

### Late/Missing work

  * Accommodations requested and verified in advance from the Office of Disability Services.
  * Religious holidays, when I am notified of them in advance.

  * I won't be able to share the code solutions if I keep accepting lates.
