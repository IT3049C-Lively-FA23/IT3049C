## Service Level Agreement

### Communication
* I will acknowledge/respond to all emails within 2 business days.
  * for every day beyond the 2 day, you'll receive an additional free late submission day. 
* I will do office hours on an as-needed, appointment-based system. Use the link on the top to schedule a meeting with me or the TA.

### Feedback and Solution
* Assignments will be graded and returned within 10 days of the due date.
  * except for the first few weeks until a TA is assigned.
* Most of the assignments will be accompanied by a suite of automatic tests that can give you an early feedback on your work.
  * For the most part, passing tests means full grade, unless indicated otherwise.
* The solutions will be shared a week after the due date using a secret code to be shared with you on the assignment feedback.
