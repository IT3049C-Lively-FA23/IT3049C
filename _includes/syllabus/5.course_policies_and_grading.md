## Course Policies

### Attendance/Participation Expectations
* You are, of course, expected to participate in all class activities.
* Given this is an online course, quizzes is one way I will employ to gauge your participation and attendance of the class.
  * Note: Quizzes are only available until their due date.

* A MS Teams channel is created for interacting with your fellow classmates - Make sure you connect and seek help.
* You're encouraged to help your classmates but be wary for when helping can be considered cheating/plagiarism.
  * When in doubt, reach out and ask :)
* You will need to maintain a line of communication with me regarding your performance. Seek me out if you need help.

### Communication protocols
* I will post announcements on Canvas (make sure it‚Äôs connected to your email)
* You may reach out to the instructor and the TA via Teams, or email.
* For any email communication with me or the TA, make sure to:
  * Send it using your School UC email.
  * Send it to my School UC email :) [yahya.gilany@uc.edu](mailto:yahya.gilany@uc.edu).
* For any questions about the class material, please post that to the [Course Team on MS Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a98d23bf924e243a2ae16a2f3aa568e2c%40thread.tacv2/General?groupId=48b253ef-0e42-4482-a4b6-e71f6892b4ce&tenantId=f5222e6c-5fc6-48eb-8f03-73db18203b63); The TA and I will be monitoring the discussions and will get back to you as soon as possible.
  * You're also encouraged to participate and answer any questions your fellow classmates may post on the board or on Canvas. **(this counts towards extra credit points)**
  * Questions about code must include:
      * a code example (or link to code in GitHub)
      * what you are trying to do
      * and what you have already tried

### Course Evaluation
The School of Information Technology requires that each course is evaluated each time it is taught.  The School uses a confidential web-based system, CoursEval, for these evaluations.  At the beginning of finals week,you will receive an email from the School Head, with ‚ÄúCoursEval‚Äù as the topic.  There is a link on that email that takes you directly to the evaluation.  The online system is anonymous.  I will receive only a summary report of combined data after final grades have been submitted.

As an instructor, I greatly value your input regarding the strengths and areas for improvement of this course.  Your feedback is essential for me to continually improve instruction and provide for quality student learning and outcomes.

## Grading
### Grading Procedure
* The assignment grades will be calculated based on 3 inputs:
  * [Your self assessment](#self-assessment).
  * Automated tests.
  * TA reviewing your code and self assessment.

#### Self Assessment
* All assignments will have a `README.md` file at the root of the project.
* On the self assessment, you're required to provide:
  * Self-reflection
  * Self-assessment of the grade you think you deserve with justifications.
    * If you complete all the required items on the assignment checklist, give your self the full grade.
    * If you leave out some of the required items, or you're not sure if you satisfied all the requirements, deduct a few points and justify that in the comments.
      * When grading you may receive higher grade that you gave your self üòâ.
    * If you don't do anything at all, Give your self half of the points.
    * If you say you did something when you didn't or not submit the assignment at all, you'll receive zero points for the assignment.
      * be honest .
      * be active.

### Late or Missing Policy
* Quizzes will not be accepted (and will not be available) once the due date has passed.

### Assignment Submission Workflow and Expectations
- Accept the GitHub Classroom assignment
  - this will copy the starter files for the assignment to a repository named as `<assignment name>-<your github username>`
- Clone down the project to your computer.
- start modifying/writing your code to satisfy the assignment requirements.
- Make sure you commit your code frequently and use a descriptive commit messages.
  - the best practice here is to commit at the end of every complete thought. (i.e. `modified the user class to validate the age input`, `updated the self assessment in the README file`)
- Once you're done with the assignment, confirm that you've updated the self evaluation and added any notes or reflections you had.
- Copy the Repository link and submit to Canvas.

**Remember to:** make sure your code is on GitHub and you didn't just commit it locally.
