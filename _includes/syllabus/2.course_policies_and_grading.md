### Course Evaluation
The School of Information Technology requires that each course is evaluated each time it is taught.  The School uses a confidential web-based system, CoursEval, for these evaluations.  At the beginning of finals week,you will receive an email from the School Head, with ‚ÄúCoursEval‚Äù as the topic.  There is a link on that email that takes you directly to the evaluation.  The online system is anonymous.  I will receive only a summary report of combined data after final grades have been submitted.

As an instructor, I greatly value your input regarding the strengths and areas for improvement of this course.  Your feedback is essential for me to continually improve instruction and provide for quality student learning and outcomes.

## Grading
### Grading Procedure
* Individual assignments will be graded based on:
  * [Your self assessment and evaluation](#self-assessment-and-grading).
  * Assignment automated tests and checks.
  * Code and Assignment Review.

* Group assignments will be graded based on:
  * [the Team's self assessment and evaluation](#self-assessment-and-grading).
  * Assignment automated tests and checks.
  * Code and Assignment Review.
  * Peer evaluation. (Further instructions will be shared)

#### Self Assessment and Grading
* All assignments will have a `README.md` file at the root directory of the project.
* On the self assessment, you're required to provide:
  * Self-reflection
  * Self-assessment of the grade you think you deserve with justifications.
    * If you complete all the required items on the assignment checklist and they work, give your self the full grade.
    * If you leave out some of the required items, or you're not sure if you satisfied all the requirements, or think you've done everything but it still doesn't work properly, deduct a few points and justify that in the comments.
      * When grading you may receive higher grade that you gave your self üòâ.
    * If nothing works (but you tried) and we can see that you tried in the code, give your self half the points.
    * If you say you did something when you didn't or not submit the assignment at all, you'll receive zero points for the assignment.
      * be honest .
      * be active.

### Late or Missing Policy
* Quizzes will not be accepted (and will not be available) once the due date has passed.
* Late work grade will be deducted 15% per day. (~3/20 points every late day)

### Assignment Submission Workflow and Expectations
- Accept the GitHub Classroom assignment
  - this will copy the starter files for the assignment to a repository named as `<assignment name>-<your github username>`
- Clone down the project to your computer.
- start modifying/writing your code to satisfy the assignment requirements.
- Make sure you commit your code frequently and use a descriptive commit messages.
  - the best practice here is to commit at the end of every complete thought. (i.e. `modified the user class to validate the age input`, `updated the self assessment in the README file`)
- Once you're done with the assignment, confirm that you've updated the self evaluation and added any notes or reflections you had.
- Copy the Repository link and submit to Canvas.

**Remember to:** make sure your code is on GitHub and you didn't just commit it locally.
