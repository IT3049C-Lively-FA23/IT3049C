## Attendance/Participation Expectations
How should they interact with one another? Is there any group work expected? How do you keep track of participation for an online course, if at all? I saw that you mentioned the quiz pw is kind of an attendance marker, but anything else?

### Notes from Selena
You mentioned all the weights and types of assignments which is good. Something that has come up with student success is that some courses do not have all the assignments and points laid out clearly, so students cannot come up with a "game plan" to successfully pass the course. In the syllabus template, there's a chart that helps lay that out. You may want to consider one for your syllabus (unless you feel like it is explicit elsewhere in the course).
