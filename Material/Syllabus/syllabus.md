## Attendance/Participation Expectations
- You are, of course, expected to participate in all class activities. Quizzes are only available until their due dates and won't be made available after the due dates passes. This is my form of collecting attendance in online classes.
- A MS Teams or a discord channel will be created for interacting with your fellow students. I won't be monitoring it but you can use it to seek help from your classmates.
- You will need to maintain a line of communication with me regarding your performance. Seek me out if you need help.
