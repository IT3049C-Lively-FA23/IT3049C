# Working in Teams (WIP)
- working on different branches
- merging the branches
- If you're working at the same time, make sure you pull the latest changes from the rest of the team.
- Make sure you push you code so your teammate can see the latest updates
- occasionally, you may get a merge conflict. This happens when both you and your classmate hace dealing with merge conflict
