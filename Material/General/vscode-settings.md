# Visual Studio Code Settings and Extensions Sync

In my demo videos, you may notice that my Visual Studio Code IDE, provides with me with a lot of cheaters, helpers, and utilities that makes development a little easier.
In this post, I'm sharing some instructions for how you can setup you VSCode IDE with the same settings and extensions I have here.

To get started:

1. you're going to need to install the Settings [Sync Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync) on VSCode.
  - Go to the link and click install. It will open VSCode and open the extension page
  - Click on `install` to download the extension

2. Once installed open VSCode Command Palette using:
  - For Windows: `ctrl`+`shift`+`P`
  - For Mac: `cmd`+`shift`+`P`

3. In the command palette, type `Sync: Download Settings`

5. Open the command palette and type `Sync: Download Settings` again and watch the extensions get installed.

6. You may need to close VSCode and open it again for all extensions to take effect.
