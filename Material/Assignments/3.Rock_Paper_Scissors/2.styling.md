# Styling using CSS and Bootstrap 4 
1. Include the Bootstrap CSS styles in the HTML head. [Instructions can be found here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/#css)
    * We don't neccessarily need to include the JS Scripts in this assignment.
    * merely doing that should make the page look something like this.
    <img alt="With bootstrap" src="assets/2.png" style="height:230px; border:1px #ddd solid;"/>

    *a little better, already*

2. Put a border around the 2 divs;
    * Make sure to include the stylesheet file below the bootstrap stylesheet.
    * *Tip:* try typing the Emmet abbreviation: `link:css` then hit enter. VSCode should make the element and you'll only need to change the path.
        <img alt="With bootstrap" src="assets/emmet-linkcss.png" style="height:230px; border:1px #ddd solid;"/>

3. In the styles.css file:
    1. set a `1px solid black;` border for `#welcome-screen`
    2. set a `1px solid red;` border for `#game-screen`

5. Apply Bootstrap classes to the buttons. [Examples on Button Classes can be found here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/buttons/)
    * Set the `Start Game!` to use the blue `btn-primary` button.
    * Set the `Go!` to use the green `btn-success` button.

6. Apply Bootstrap class `custom-select` to select dropdown. [More Info here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/forms/#select-menu)

7. for the `div` immedietly below the `form`, give it a class name of `form-group`
**It should now look like this.**
<img alt="after styling" src="assets/3.png" style="height:230px; border:1px #ddd solid;"/>
