# Setting up the Layout

* Inside the `<div class="container">`, create the following elements nested as follows:
    * `<h1>` - with a title of *Rock Paper Scissors*.
    * 2 `<div>`s with IDs of `welcome-screen` & `game-screen`.
        * *Tip:* try typing the [emmet abbreviation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/html#_emmet-snippets) `#welcome-screen+#game-screen` and hit enter. ðŸ˜‰

    * Inside `<div id="welcome-screen">`, create the following elements nested as follows:
        * `<form>`
            * `<div>` 
                * `<label>` - with the text of *Your Name*.
                * `<input>` - with a placeholder text of *Enter Name Here...*.
            * `<button>` - with the text of *Start Game!*.

    * Inside `<div id="game-screen">`, create the following elements nested as follows:
        * `<div>` - with an id of `score-tally`.
            * `<p>` - with id of `score` and text of `User: 0 v CPU: 0`
                * *Tip:* [Emmet abbreviation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/html#_emmet-snippets) for a div with an id of `score-tally` and a paragraph with id of `score` is `#score-tally>p#score`.
    * `<form>` - with an id of `game-form`
        * `<div>` 
            * `<label>` - with a text of *Select your choice:*
            * `<select>` - with an id of `user-selection` and 3 `option`s for *Rock*, *Paper*, & *Scissors*
                * *Tip:* use the [Emmet abbreviation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/html#_emmet-snippets): `select#user-selection>option*3`
        * `<button>` - with the text of `Go!`.

## Result
**It should now look like this.**
<img alt="initial look" src="../../assets/1.png" style="height:230px; border:1px #ddd solid;"/>

*I think We can do a little better.*
