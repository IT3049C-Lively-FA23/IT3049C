## Lab Goals
1. Create a Rock, Paper, Scissors game
2. Demonstrate ability to create forms with the form/input elements
3. Demonstrate understanding of event-oriented programming

## Instructions
For this assignment we will be building our first game of the semester: Rock, Paper, Scissors. Your
goal is to build this game using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the concepts/techniques we have covered
these past two weeks to allow a user to play the game against the Computer. The process of the game
should be:
1. Web page loads with form to input user’s name (input is required, they cannot submit it without a value)
2. User submits name and a new form appears with an input for Rock, Paper, or Scissors (you can use an input or select, whatever you choose)
3. User submits the form with their selection (input is required, they cannot submit it without a selection)
4. Generate the Computer’s selection
5. Use logic to determine winner
6. Display the winner
7. Keep history of selections and winner of each round
8. Reset the form after each round

## Example
<img alt="example image" src="assets/example.png" style="height:250px; border:1px #ddd solid;"/>

## Tips and Guidelines
* Do not push everything in one commit.
* Use useful commit messages

### Grading
1. The application runs with no errors.
2. The computer player is able to select a random option on every play.
3. The game logic is sound.
  a. Win
  b. Lost
  c. And Tie
4. The playing history is maintained and presented to the user. (see the screenshot above where it has Round 1, 2,…)
5. For 4 points of Extra Credit: User can Reset the game and Type in a new player name.
6. For 2 points of Extra Credit: Make the game aesthetically pleasing (just adding Rock Paper Scissor images doesn’t count ☺)
