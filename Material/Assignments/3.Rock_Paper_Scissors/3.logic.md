# Implementing Game Logic

The Resources folder structure should look something like this.
```
resources
├── images
│   └── .gitkeep
├── scripts
│   ├── rock_paper_scissors.js ⬅️
│   └── index.js
└── styles
    └── styles.css
```
In this step, we will be working on the file marked with the ⬅️

In the `scripts/rock_paper_scissors.js`, we will make a `RockPaperScissors` class that will contain all logic for the game (properties and methods). and in the `scripts/index.js` file, we will handle the user input and call methods from the `RockPaperScissors` class as needed.

## `RockPaperScissors` Class
This class will only contain 2 methods:
1. `generateCPUResponse()`
2. `determineWinner()`

### `generateCPUResponse()`
For this function:
1. Create an array with the following values 
```js
const acceptedValues = [ `rock`, `paper`, `scissors` ]
```
2. Using both [Math.random](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random) and [Math.floor()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/floor) methods in conjunction to generate a random index number (0,1,2)
3. return the value of acceptedValue at the random index generated in the previous step.

### `determineWinner()`
This function will take 2 parameters `userSelection` and `cpuSelection` and will return one of the following values (`win`, `lose`, `tie`). 
* it would return (tie) if the user selection is the same as the cpu random selection.
* it would return (win) if:
    * user selection is `rock` and cpu selection is `scissors`
    * OR
    * user selection is `paper` and cpu selection is `rock`
    * OR 
    * user selection is `scissors` and cpu selection is `paper`
* it would return (lose) in any other case.


## Result
**Running the unit tests should pass**
