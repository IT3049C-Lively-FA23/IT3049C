## Lab Goals
1. Practice the usage of Git and GitHub in submitting the assignments.
2. Review creating simple web pages using HTML
3. Review styling web pages using CSS to make the page look aestatically pleasing.
4. Deploy your site and hosting in on GitHub Pages.
5. I need to learn about you :)
6. Introduce yourself to the class as you'll need to team up for the final project.

## Instructions
This is a 2-parts lab; in the first, you'll practice creating HTML page, with CSS and checking-in your work to a GitHub Repository where you're the only collaborator. and in the second, you'll practice creating a branch on a repository with multiple collaborators and submitting a pull request.

The starter project will include a few files that I ask you not to mess with. This will aid in providing you early feedback on your code before submitting the assignment.

### Part 1: Create a Web Page
1. Accept the assignment: This will create a repository for you with a few starting files. with the following folder structure

```

│   └── workflows <-- Don't Modify
│       └── nodejs.yml <-- Don't Modify
├── resources
│   ├── images
│   │   └── .gitkeep
│   ├── scripts
│   │   └── index.js
│   └── styles
│       └── styles.css
├── tests <-- Don't Modify
│   ├── folderStructure.test.js <-- Don't Modify
│   └── htmlContent.test.js <-- Don't Modify
├── .gitignore <-- Don't Modify

  * Personal background
  * Picture of yourself.
  * Work and Development Experience
  * Programming Languages
  * Achievements
  * Favourite Games (or ones you’re currently playing)
3. Commit every section as a separate commit.
4. Once you are finished, make sure you push all the changes to the repository.
5. Setup GitHub Pages to host the site.

### Part 2: Create Pull Request

## Tips and Guidelines
