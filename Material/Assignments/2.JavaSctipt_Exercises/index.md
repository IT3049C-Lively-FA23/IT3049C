## Lab Goals
This Lab is collection of JavaScript execises and coding challenges. It's focused on problem solving techniques and JavaScript Fundamentals.

## Tips and Guidelines
* Make a git commit at the **end of each** of the exercises. There are 20 tests, so there should be 20+ commits at the end of this.

## Instructions
1. Accept the Assignment on Canvas.
  * This will create a repository for you with a few starting files.
    ```
      .
      â”œâ”€â”€ .vscode
      â”‚   â””â”€â”€ settings.json
      â”œâ”€â”€ src
      â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __tests__
      â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 1.numbers.js
      â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 2.strings.js
      â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 3.arrays.js
      â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 4.logicalOperators.js
      â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 5.flowControl.js
      â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 6.equality.js
      â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 1.numbers.js
      â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 2.strings.js
      â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 3.arrays.js
      â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 4.logicalOperators.js
      â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 5.flowControl.js
      â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 6.equality.js
      â”œâ”€â”€ .eslintrc.json
      â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
      â”œâ”€â”€ package-lock.json
      â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
      â””â”€â”€ README.md
    ```
  * you will only be working on files in the 
2. Clone down the repository to your local computer.
3. Install the project dependencies using the `npm install` command.
4. Run the project tests using `npm test`
  You should see all the tests failing like so:
  ![](assets/)
6. For this assignment, you will modifying the files in the app folder. Each file repesent a suite of function that you'll implement untill all the tests pass.
7. Don't forget to fill out the self assessment in the `README.md` file.
8. commit and push your code.

### Demo:
#### Setup
1. Navigate to your repository in the command line using the `cd PATH_TO_FOLDER` command.
  - in my case the command was `cd /Users/yahyagilany/git/School/IT3049/2.JS-Exercise`
  - use the `pwd` command to `P`rint `W`orking `D`irectory.
2. Installing the dependencies `npm install`
3. starting the project `npm start` and opening `127.0.0.100:4444` in the browser.
  <img alt="example image" src="assets/browser_failing_tests.png" style="height:400px; border:1px #ddd solid;"/>
  - notice all the errors, our goal for this assignment is to resolve them all.
  - on the top, you see the tally of how many tests passed, and how many are failing.
  - next to each test, there's a little play button to run that a specific test.


#### Getting Down to Business
1. Open the project in *Visual Studio Code* (Not Visual Studio)
  <img alt="example image" src="assets/visualStudioCode.png" style="height:400px; border:1px #ddd solid;"/>
2. Open the file `app/1.array.js`
  - notice all the functions have empty implementations, our tasks is provide implementation so the tests pass.
3. After consulting the JS documeantion provided at the top of the file (OR [this one](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)), you should be able to identify the functions needed to be used.
4. for the first test, the `indexOf` method is supposed to return the index of a certain element in an array. [You can learn more about JS Built-in method here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/indexOf)
5. my implementation for this is as follows
  ```js
    function indexOf(arr, item) {
        return arr.indexOf(item);
    }
  ```

6. Look back on the tests page on the browser. Notice the test pass.
  <img alt="example image" src="assets/passing_test.png" style="height:400px; border:1px #ddd solid;"/>
7. Commit the changes with a proper commit messgae.
8. On to the next test .. Rinse and RepeatðŸ§ª
