## Lab Goals
1. Review creating simple web pages using *HTML* and the different ways to present content.
2. Review styling web pages using *CSS* to make the page look aesthetically pleasing.
3. Practice the **usage of Git and GitHub** in submitting the assignments.
    * Make Frequent git commits. 
        * ðŸ’¬ As a rule of thumb, you should commit your code at the end of every complete thought.
        * ðŸš© Planning your code will help you identify checkpoints <img alt="commit logo" height="15" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/Octicons-git-commit.svg/1200px-Octicons-git-commit.svg.png"/> where you can commit your code.
        * Use meaningful commit messages.
        * The instructions will suggest a few checkpoints where you can commit the code.
            * This won't be in all assignments.
4. Deploy your site and hosting in on *GitHub Pages*.
5. I need to learn about you :)
6. Introduce yourself to the class as you'll need to team up for the final project.
